The country in which the observation was recorded,The air emissions value,"How the observation was made. Either 'Estimated', 'Provisional Value', or 'Time series break'. A provisional value is one that was estimated with the expectation that the value would change. A time series break is when a pattern in the data aburptly changes in comparison to previous or following years.",The units the emissions are in.
