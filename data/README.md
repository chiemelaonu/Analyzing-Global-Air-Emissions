An initial note for the structure of the data set: The original data had 2 columns for 
each distinct variable. For example, there would be a column titled "Observation Status" and
"OBS_STATUS". The columns had slightly different language, one usually having abbreviations as the 
observations, whereas the other had the full and clear observation, but they both essentially 
represented the same thing. I removed the repeating columns for each distinct variable.
Some of the ones I removed may have had clearer observations,so I will be putting a short 
description of each of the columns I left in the data, so that hopefully the data
will still be easy to understand.
