## Analysis of Global Air Emissions


This project is intended to look at the yearly/quarterly emissions recorded from 
different countries and to find relationships among the data. That will be done through 
making plots and analysis of those plots. I intend to do my own research outside of the data
that can help supplement the findings from the dataset, in the hopes of coming to more well-rounded 
conclusions and to make better inferences as well. 

## What is in the Repo

The repository will have 3 scripts, which will include the initial loading in 
of data and cleaning the data, the univariate analysis, and the multivariate analysis.
The scripts will be organized with comments to understand my thought processes.

### Subfolders
-   [`data/`](data): contains the data for the project

### R scripts
-   `data_cleaning.R`: holds the initial reading in and tidying of data

-   `2_multivariate_analysis.R`: holds the more complex and multivariate EDA

### Reports
